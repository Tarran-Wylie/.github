## Hi there 👋
These are some small C# and .NET framework projects I made.

Projects:
CarInsurance
    +
StudentApp

CarInsurance: This MVC application takes a users input and outputs an Insurance quote based on buisness logic. 
This application also has a Admin section to moniter user input and data.

StudentApp: Using EntityFramework 6 this application takes, inputs and moniters data about students who are joining.
